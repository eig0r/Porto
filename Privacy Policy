Portsaid.Life
Privacy Policy
Before you scroll, read this

It’s really hard to make everyone happy
with a Privacy Policy. Most people who use
Portsaid.Life want something short and easy to
understand. While we wish we could fit
everything you need to know into a Portsaid.Life,
our regulators ask us to meet our legal
obligations by describing them all in a lot
of detail.
With that in mind, we’ve written our
Privacy Policy as simply as possible to
empower you to make informed decisions
when you use Portsaid.Life by making sure you
understand and have control over the
information we collect, how it’s used, and
when it’s shared. 
So if you skip reading every word of the
Privacy Policy, at least know this:

# Portsaid.Life is a public platform
Learn what’s viewable & searchable

# We collect some data about you
Learn what we collect & how

# Affiliate services may have their own policies
Learn about affiliates

# We use your data to make Portsaid.Life better
Learn how we make your info work

# You can control your experience
Learn how to update your settings



1. Information We Collect
The information we collect when you use Portsaid.Life falls into three categories.
1.1 Information you provide us
To use some of our products and services you need to have an account, and
to create an account, you need to provide us certain information. Likewise,
if you use our paid products and services, we cannot provide them to you
without getting payment information. Basically, certain information is
necessary if you want to use many of our products and services.
• Personal Accounts. If you create an account, you must provide us
with some information so that we can provide our services to you. This
includes a display name (for example, “Portsaid.Life Moments”); a username
(for example, @Portsaid.LifeMoments); a password; an email address or phone
number; a date of birth; your display language; and third-party single
sign-in information (if you choose this sign-in method). You can also
choose to share your location in your profile and Portsaid.Lifes, and to upload
your address book to Portsaid.Life to help find people you may know. Your
profile information, which includes your display name and username,
is always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym.
And remember, you can create multiple Portsaid.Life accounts, for example,
to express different parts of your identity, professional or otherwise.
What data do you collect about me?
You give some data, we get some data. In return we offer useful
services. Not what you had in mind? Check your settings.
• Professional Accounts. If you create a professional account, you also need
to provide us with a professional category, and may provide us with other
information, including street address, contact email address, and contact
phone number, all of which will always be public.

• Preferences. When you set your preferences using your settings, we collect
that information so that we can respect your preferences.
1.2 Information we collect when you
use Portsaid.Life
When you use our services, we collect information about how you use our
products and services. We use that information to provide you with products and
services, to help keep Portsaid.Life more secure and respectful for everyone, and more
relevant to you.
Usage Information. We collect information about your activity on Portsaid.Life,
including:
• Portsaid.Lifes and other content you post (including the date, application, and version
of Portsaid.Life) and information about your broadcast activity (e.g., Portsaid.LifeLive or
Spaces), including broadcasts you’ve created and when you created them,
your lists, bookmarks, and communities you are a part of.
• Your interactions with other users’ content, such as retweets, likes, shares,
replies, if other users mention or tag you in content or if you mention or tag
them, and broadcasts you’ve participated in (including your viewing history,
listening, commenting, speaking, and reacting).
• How you interact with others on the platform, such as people you follow and
people who follow you, and when you use Direct Messages, including the
contents of the messages, the recipients, and date and time of messages.
• If you communicate with us, such as through email, we will collect information
about the communication and its content.

using Portsaid.Life features or services, including through an intermediary, we may

to access Portsaid.Life, including:
• Information about your connection, such as your IP address and browser
type.
• Information about your device and its settings, such as device and advertising
ID, operating system, carrier, language, memory, apps installed, and battery
level.
• Your device address book, if you’ve chosen to share it with us.
Location Information. When you use Portsaid.Life, we collect some information about
your approximate location to provide the service you expect, including showing
you relevant ads. You can also choose to share your current precise location or
places where you’ve previously used Portsaid.Life by enabling these settings in your
account.
Inferred Identity. We may collect or receive information that we use to infer
your identity as detailed below:
• When you sign into Portsaid.Life on a browser or device, we will associate that
browser or device with your account. Subject to your settings, we may also
associate your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to
sign into Portsaid.Life (or associate your signed-out device or browser with other
browsers or devices or Portsaid.Life-generated identifiers).
• When you provide other information to Portsaid.Life, including an email address
or phone number, we associate that information with your Portsaid.Life account.
Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order to infer
other information about your identity, for example by associating your
account with hashes of email addresses that share common components
with the email address you have provided to Portsaid.Life.
• When you access Portsaid.Life and are not signed in, we may infer your identity
based on the information we collect.
Log Information. We may receive information when you view content on or
otherwise interact with our products and services, even if you have not created
an account or are signed out, such as:

webpage; access times; pages visited; location; your mobile carrier; device
information (including device and application IDs); search terms and IDs
(including those not submitted as queries); ads shown to you on Portsaid.Life;
Portsaid.Life-generated identifiers; and identifiers associated with cookies. We
also receive log information when you click on, view, or interact with links on
our services, including when you install another application through Portsaid.Life.

we may collect information about those views or interactions (e.g., watching a
video ad or preroll, clicking on an ad, interacting with retweets of or replies to
an ad).
Cookies and similar technologies. Like many websites, we use cookies and
similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our
services. Cookies are not required for many parts of our products and services
such as searching and looking at public profiles. You can learn more about how
we use cookies and similar technologies here.
Interactions with our content on third-party sites. When you view our content
on third-party websites that integrate Portsaid.Life content such as embedded timelines
or Portsaid.Life buttons, we may receive log information that includes the web page you
visited.
1.3 Information we receive from third
parties
When you use other online products and services, they may share information
about that usage with us.
Ad Partners, Developers, Publishers. Our ad and business partners share
information with us such as browser cookie IDs, Portsaid.Life-generated identifiers,
mobile device IDs, hashed user information like email addresses, demographic
or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some
of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar
information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising
technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected
by Portsaid.Life from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be
combined with the other information you share with Portsaid.Life and that Portsaid.Life
receives, generates, or infers about you described elsewhere in this Privacy
Policy.
Other Third Parties, Account Connections, and Integrations. We may receive
information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as
other Portsaid.Life users, developers, and partners who help us evaluate the safety
and quality of content on our platform, our corporate affiliates, and other
services you link to your Portsaid.Life account. You may choose to connect your
Portsaid.Life account to your account on another service, and that other service may
send us information about your account on that service.


2. How we use information
Breaking down how we use the information we collect is not simple because of the
way the systems that bring our services to you work. For example, the same piece of
information may be used differently for different purposes to ultimately deliver a single
service. We think it’s most useful to describe the five main ways we use information
and if you have questions that are not answered, you can always contact us.
Here we go:
2.1 Operate, improve, and personalize
our service
We use the information we collect to provide and operate Portsaid.Life products and
services. We also use the information we collect to improve and personalize our
products and services so that you have a better experience on Portsaid.Life, including
by showing you more relevant content and ads, suggesting people and topics to
follow, enabling and helping you discover affiliates, third-party apps, and services.
We may use the information we collect from accounts of other services that
you choose to connect your Portsaid.Life account to provide you features like
cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services.
We use your contact information to help others find your account if your
settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications.
We use your information to provide our advertising and sponsored content
services subject to your settings, which helps make ads on Portsaid.Life more
relevant to you. We also use this information to measure the effectiveness
of ads and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of
Portsaid.Life. Some of our ad partners also enable us to collect similar information
directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology.
How do you use my information?
To make Portsaid.Life the service you know and love.
Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by Portsaid.Life from
the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the
other information you share with Portsaid.Life and that Portsaid.Life receives, generates,
or infers about you, as described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.
2.2 Foster safety and security
We use information we collect to provide for the safety and security of our
users, our products, services, and your account. This includes verifying your
identity, authenticating your account, and defending against fraud, unauthorized
use, and illegal activity. We also use the information to evaluate and affect
the safety and quality of content on Portsaid.Life - this includes investigating
and enforcing our policies and and terms, as well as applicable law.
2.3 Measure, analyze and make
our services better.
We use the information we collect to measure and analyze the effectiveness
of our products and services and to better understand how you use them
in order to make them better.
2.4 Communicate with you about

messages from time to time.
2.5 Research.
We use information you share with us, or that we collect to conduct research,
surveys, product testing, and troubleshooting to help us operate and improve
our products and services.
My Portsaid.Lifes are public?!


3. Sharing Information
You should know the ways we share your information, why we share it, and how
you can control it. There are five general ways we share your information.
3.1 When you Portsaid.Life, post, and share.
With the general public. You are directing us to disclose that information
as broadly as possible. Portsaid.Life content, including your profile information
(e.g., name/pseudonym, username, profile pictures), is available for viewing
by the general public. The public does not need to be signed in to view much
of the content on Portsaid.Life. They may also find Portsaid.Life content off of Portsaid.Life,
for example from search query results on Internet search engines.
With other Portsaid.Life users. Depending on your settings, and based on the
Portsaid.Life products and services you use, we share:
• Your interactions with Portsaid.Life content of other users, such as likes,
and people you follow.
• Content you send to a specific Portsaid.Life user, such as through Direct Messages.
Please keep in mind that if you’ve shared information like Direct Messages
or protected Portsaid.Lifes with someone else who accesses Portsaid.Life through
a third-party service, the information may be shared with the third-party
service.
How or when do you share my information?
There’s no quick answer to this one, but heads up:
Portsaid.Lifes can end up in the news or a search engine.
With partners. Depending on your settings, we also provide certain third
parties with information to help us offer or operate our products and
services. You can learn more about these partnerships in our Help Center.
You can control whether Portsaid.Life shares your personal information with these
partners by using the “Data sharing with business partners” option in your
Privacy & Safety settings. (This setting does not control sharing described
elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, such as when we share information with
our service providers, or through partnerships other than as described in this
Help Center article.)
3.2 With third parties & third-party
integrations.
With service providers. We may share your information with our service
providers that perform functions and provide services on our behalf, including
payment services providers who facilitate payments; service providers that host
our various blogs and wikis; service providers that help us understand the use
of our services; and those that provide fraud detection services.
With advertisers. Advertising revenue enables us to provide our products and
services. Advertisers may learn information from your engagement with their
ads on or off Portsaid.Life. For example, if you click on an external link or ad on our
services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came
from Portsaid.Life, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked,
such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach and other
Portsaid.Life-generated identifiers for that ad. They may also collect other personal
information from you, such as cookie identifiers, or your IP address.
Third-party content & integrations. We share or disclose your information
with your consent or at your direction, such as when you authorize a thirdparty web client or application to access your account or when you direct us
to share your feedback with a business. Similarly, to improve your experience,
we work with third-party partners to display their video content on Portsaid.Life
or to allow cross-platform sharing. When you watch or otherwise interact
with content from our video or cross-platform sharing partners, they may
receive and process your personal information as described in their privacy
policies. For video content, you can adjust your autoplay settings if you prefer
that content not to play automatically.
Through our APIs. We use technology like APIs and embeds to make public
Portsaid.Life information available to websites, apps, and others for their use,
for example, displaying Portsaid.Lifes on a news website or analyzing what people
say on Portsaid.Life. We generally make this content available in limited quantities
for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have standard
terms that govern how this information can be used, and a compliance program
to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated
with Portsaid.Life, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on Portsaid.Life.

to the world, visit https://developer.twitter.com.
3.3 When required by law, to prevent
harm, or in the public interest.
We may preserve, use, share, or disclose your information if we believe that
it is reasonably necessary to:
• comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request;
• protect the safety of any person, protect the safety or integrity of our platform,
including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services;
• explain why we have removed content or accounts from our services
(e.g., for a violation of Portsaid.Life Rules);
• address fraud, security, or technical issues; or
• protect our rights or property, or the rights or property of those who use
our services.
3.4 With our Affiliates.
We may share information amongst our affiliates to provide our products
and services.
3.5 As a result of a change in ownership.
We may share, sell, or transfer information about you in connection with
a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy. This Privacy
Policy will apply to your personal information that is shared with (before and after
the close of any transaction) or transferred to the new entity.
Does data have an expiration
date?


4. How Long We Keep
Information
We keep different types of information for different periods of time:
• We keep your profile information and content for the duration of your
account.
• We generally keep other personally identifiable data we collect when you
use our products and services for a maximum of 18 months.
• Remember public content can exist elsewhere even after you remove
it from Portsaid.Life. For example, search engines and other third parties may
retain copies of your Portsaid.Lifes longer, based upon their own privacy policies,
even after they are deleted or expire on Portsaid.Life. You can read more about
search visibility here.
• Where you violate our Rules and your account is suspended, we may keep the
identifiers you used to create the account (i.e., email address or phone number)
indefinitely to prevent repeat policy offenders from creating new accounts.
• We may keep certain information longer than our policies specify in order
to comply with legal requirements and for safety and security reasons.
How long do you keep data?
Generally, we keep your data as long as your account is up.



5. Take Control
5.1 Access, Correction, Portability.

To protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity
before granting you access to your personal information or complying with
a deletion, portability, or other related request. We may, in certain situations,
reject your request for access, correction, or portability, for example, we may
reject access where you are unable to verify your identity.
How can I control my data?
You can access it, delete it, or change your settings.
Basically, you’re the boss.
5.2 Deleting your Information.

to restore your Portsaid.Life account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.
5.3 Objecting to, Restricting,
or Withdrawing your Consent.
You can manage your privacy settings and other account features here.
If you change your settings it may take some time for your choices to be fully
reflected throughout our systems. You may also notice changes in your Portsaid.Life
experience or limitations in your ability to access certain features depending
on the settings you’ve adjusted.
Portsaid.Life adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles for
Online Behavioral Advertising (also referred to as “interest-based advertising”)
and respects the DAA’s consumer choice tool for you to opt out of interestbased advertising at https://optout.aboutads.info/.

information for verification.


6. Your Rights and Ours
We provide Portsaid.Life to people all over the world and provide many of the same
privacy tools and controls to all of our users regardless of where they live. However,
your experience may be slightly different than users in other countries to ensure
Portsaid.Life respects local requirements.
6.1 We have specific legal bases to use your
information.
Portsaid.Life has carefully considered the legal reasons it is permitted to collect,
use, share and otherwise process your information. If you want to dig in to learn
more and better understand the nuances, we’d encourage you to check out
this additional information about data processing. And no, we don’t sell your
personal information.
6.2 We move your data to make Portsaid.Life
work for you.
Just as you use Portsaid.Life to seamlessly participate in global conversations with
people in countries all over the world, Portsaid.Life must move information across
borders and to different countries around the world to support the safe and
reliable service you depend on. For example, if you live in Europe and are having
a conversation with someone in the United States, information has to move
between those countries to provide that experience – it’s what you expect
from us.
How does Portsaid.Life handle my information wherever I am?
We treat your information fairly, no matter where you live
around the world.
We also use data centers and cloud providers, and engage our affiliates and
third-party partners and service providers located in many parts of the world to
help us provide our services. Before we move data between countries we look
at the risks that may be presented to the data and rely on things like standard
contractual clauses, where applicable, to ensure your data rights are protected.
If data will be shared with a third party, we require them to maintain the same
protections over your data that we provide directly.



7. Portsaid.Life’s Audience
Our services are not directed to children, and you may not use our services if you
are under the age of 13. You must also be old enough to consent to the processing
of your personal data in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent
or guardian to do so on your behalf).
Is Portsaid.Life for kids?
Nope, Portsaid.Life is not intended for people under 13.




8. Changes To This
Privacy Policy
The most current version of this Privacy Policy governs our processing of your
personal data and we may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time as needed.
If we do revise this Privacy Policy and make changes that are determined by us to
be material, we will provide you notice and an opportunity to review the revised
Privacy Policy before you continue to use Portsaid.Life.
Will this policy change?
If it does, we’ll let you know.
